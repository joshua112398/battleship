# Battleship
This is a replica of the classic Battleship game, now playable on your browser. The app consists of mostly the game itself along with any logic associated with it. There is a computer AI that users can play against. 

# Implementation
It uses Vanilla JavaScript with test-driven development in mind to test that the various modules and functionalities work as they should. In addition, it uses ES6 modules to follow OOP principles.

# Challenges
Getting confused with firstChild and firstElementChild again when deleting children of a parent node.

I still wasn't sure of when to use mocking for creating unit tests, since a lot of the basic functionality of the app didn't really seem to require mocking at all.
